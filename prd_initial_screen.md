# PRD: Initial Screen & First-Time User Experience

## 1. Overview

This document specifies the design and functional requirements for the initial screen of the SimplyScannerPro application. The primary goal of this screen is to provide a zero-friction onboarding experience that immediately guides the user into the app's core scanning functionality.

## 2. Visual Design and Layout

The initial screen will be designed as depicted in the mockup above. The layout is clean, modern, and focused on guiding the user to their first scan.

### 2.1. Key UI Components

*   **Navigation Bar**:
    *   **Title**: "SimplyScanner".
    *   **Left Button**: A standard menu icon to access application settings.
    *   **Right Button**: No button will be displayed on the right side during the initial startup.

*   **Function Bar**:
    *   A secondary bar below the navigation bar will provide quick access to document management functions:
        *   **Search**: Icon to initiate a search for documents.
        *   **Import**: Icon to import images from the device's gallery.
        *   **New Folder**: Icon to create a new document folder.
        *   **Sort**: Icon to change the sorting order of documents.
        *   **View Mode**: A switch to toggle between list and grid views.
        *   **Select**: Icon to enter selection mode for batch operations.

*   **Main Content Area**:
    *   **Empty State**: On first launch, this area will display an empty state to guide the user.
        *   **Background Image**: A subtle, branded background image.
        *   **Guiding Text**: The text "Add your first document!" will be displayed prominently in the center.
        *   **Animated Arrow**: A downward-pointing arrow will be animated to guide the user's attention toward the scan button.
    *   **Scan Button**: A circular button with a camera/photograph icon, located in the bottom right, which serves as the primary call to action to start scanning.

*   **Ad Banner**: A banner ad from Google AdMob will be displayed at the very bottom of the screen.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Initial State

*   On first launch, the main content area will display the empty state, as described in section 2.1.
*   All buttons in the **Function Bar** will be enabled but will operate on an empty set of documents.
*   The animated downward arrow will continuously point to the **Scan Button** to guide the user.

### 3.2. User Actions

*   **Scan Button**: Tapping this button will launch the native `VNDocumentCameraViewController` to initiate a new scan.
*   **Function Bar Buttons**: Tapping any of the function bar buttons (e.g., Search, Import, Sort) will perform their respective actions. On first launch, these actions will have no effect on the main content area, as there are no documents to manage.

## 4. User Flow

1.  User launches the app for the first time.
2.  The initial screen is displayed, showing the empty state with the "Add your first document!" text and the animated arrow pointing to the Scan Button.
3.  The user is prompted to tap the **Scan Button**.
4.  Upon tapping the Scan Button, the document scanning interface opens.
5.  After a successful scan, the main content area will be updated to display the newly created document, and the empty state will be hidden.
